<div style="font-size:14px;">
I’m a Fine Arts graduate, which may not seem directly related to coding, but it has taught me the importance of <b>attention to detail, commitment, and always striving for excellence.</b>✨ My background has helped me develop <b>strong organizational and planning skills</b>. After finishing my degree, I focused on digital design and had the opportunity to work in that field. However, I felt the need for a new challenge, which led me to explore coding. 🎯 I believe that combining <b>back-end, front-end, design, and UX/UI</b> will help me build a well-rounded and versatile skill set.

I may be new to coding, but I’m highly experienced in <b>problem-solving, quick learning</b> (something I’m particularly good at), and thinking creatively.💡 I’m always up for new challenges and excited to see where this journey will take me!✈️
